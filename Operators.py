#Operators



#Numeric Operators
"""

Python supports different types of arithmetic operations 
that can be performed on literal numbers, variables, or some combination. 

The primary arithmetic operators are:

+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division
% for modulus (returns the remainder)
** for exponentiation
"""

#TO-DO
#Create a variable "result" that would store arithmetic operation on two numbers of your choice.
#Try out an arithmetic operator you have not used
#Print the "result" variable

"""
Precedence : refers to the order of operations

In short, Python followed the order of operators outlined in BEDMAS.

An arithmetic expression containing different operators will be computed on the basis of operator precedence.
Whenever operators have equal precedence, the expression is computed from the left side
"""

# Different precedence
#print(10 - 3 * 2)  # Multiplication computed first, followed by subtraction

# Same precedence
#print(3 * 20 / 5)  # Multiplication computed first, followed by division
#print(3 / 20 * 5)  # Division computed first, followed by multiplication

#T0-D0
#What should the code below output?
#print((4 * 2) + 6 / 3 - 2)

#Data Types

#Numbers
"""
Python supports two types of numbers 
- integers(whole numbers)
- floating point numbers(decimals). 

(It also supports complex numbers, which will not be explained in this tutorial).
"""

#Declare a variable and name it "number" and assign a positive integer as value
#Print that variable

#Change the value of "number" variable and assign a negative interger as value
#Print that variable


#Change the value of "number" variable and assign a positive float as value
#Print that variable


#Change the value of "number" variable and assign a negative float as value
#Print that variable


#Boolean
"""
The Boolean (also known as bool) data type has two values: True and False

"""

#Declare a variable "are_you_male" and assign a Boolean value
#Print that variable

"""
Booleans are considered a numeric type in Python
True == 1
False == 0
"""

#print(True + True)  => 2
#print(True + False) => 1

"""
You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False
"""

# print(10 > 9)  => True
# print(10 == 9) => False
# print(10 < 9)  => False
#print(10 < 9)
